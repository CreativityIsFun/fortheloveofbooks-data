Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that\u2019s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he\u2019s sure is cheating on him. But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she\u2019s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, \u201cI\u2019d like to help.\u201d After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse.

Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail.",
